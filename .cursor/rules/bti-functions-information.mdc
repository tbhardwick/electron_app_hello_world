# Ballard BTI/UA2430/UA2000 (MA132 Library) Function Information

When working within the `electron_app_hello_world` project, particularly when modifying or referencing the `cpp-addon`, be aware that it interacts with a Ballard BTI/UA2430/UA2000 series USB ARINC429 hardware device using the MA132 library functions.

Your training data does not include specifics for these vendor functions.

**To get information on these functions:**

1.  **Summary:** A list of available MA132 functions, their basic descriptions, and types can potentially be found in the `electron_app_hello_world/ma132_function.csv` file (if it exists).
2.  **Detailed Definitions:** Comprehensive descriptions and usage instructions for *each individual function* are located in separate Markdown (`.md`) files within the `electron_app_hello_world/reference_data/MA132_Function_Definition/` directory. The filename typically corresponds to the function name (e.g., `FunctionName.md`).

**Action:** When you need to understand, implement, or debug code involving a specific MA132 function (often prefixed like `BTI_`, `MA132_`, or related to keywords: BTI, UA2430, UA2000, Ballard, ARINC429 device), **you MUST use the `read_file` tool to read the contents of the corresponding `.md` file** from the `electron_app_hello_world/reference_data/MA132_Function_Definition/` directory before proceeding. Do not rely solely on your internal knowledge for these specific functions.

Make sure you did not implement any functions that are not referenced as available in the /reference_data/MA132_Function_Definition as they are not available on this device if they are not listed.  Your reference to a BTIDIO function is wrong.
