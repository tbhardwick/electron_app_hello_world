# Native Libraries Directory

This directory is reserved for native library files (DLLs/LIBs) that provide the UA2430 hardware integration.

## Expected Files

- `ua2430.dll` - Windows DLL for UA2430 hardware
- `ua2430.lib` - Windows LIB for UA2430 hardware
- Additional supporting DLLs or configuration files needed by the UA2430 libraries

## Notes

- These libraries are loaded by the native bridge processes, not directly by Electron
- Do not place executable files here; those belong in the native-bridge directory
- Ensure platform-specific libraries are organized appropriately if supporting multiple platforms
